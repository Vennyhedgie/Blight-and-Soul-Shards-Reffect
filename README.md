# Blight-and-Soul-Shards-Reffect
A more visible UI element for Necromancer's Spear and Harbinger Elite Specialization

This pack contains two elements:
- Adds a blight bar on top of life force, with notches every 5 stacks, to easily keep track of thresholds to use elixirs in. This only displays while playing as harbinger.
- Adds an indicator for Soul Shards when wielding a spear (Or when having at least 1 shard while in shroud).

# How to use
Simply download the zip file to your reffect root folder like so:

Then right click > Extract here (the necessary files will be added to the packs and icons subfolders).

Then, return to reffect ingame and refresh packs.

While playing as Ritualist or Scourge, the shards will be centered instead:

You can also use this on Reaper or Harbinger if you'd prefer, by changing the filter to include them and disabling the other Spear UI:

# Notes

This effect is made with Normal interface size. If you use a different one, you can resize all the elements at once by right-clicking on the pack and selecting resize. Alternatively, you can move the pack's position on screen if needed, though it should be aligned by default.
