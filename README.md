# Blight-and-Soul-Shards-Reffect
A more visible UI element for Necromancer's Spear and Harbinger Elite Specialization

This pack contains two elements:
- Adds a blight bar on top of life force, with notches every 5 stacks, to easily keep track of thresholds to use elixirs in. This only displays while playing as harbinger.
- Adds an indicator for Soul Shards when wielding a spear (Or when having at least 1 shard while in shroud).

While playing as Ritualist or Scourge, the shards will be centered instead:

# How to use

Then right click > Extract here (the necessary files will be added to the packs and icons subfolders).

Then, return to reffect ingame and refresh packs.

Finally, enable your interface size of choice:

# Notes

You can also use the centered UI on Reaper or Harbinger if you'd prefer, by changing the filter to include them and disabling the other Spear UI:
